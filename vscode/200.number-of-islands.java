 *
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of
 * islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
 * adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of
 * the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * 11110
 * 11010
 * 11000
 * 00000
 *
 * Output:Â 1

 * 11000
 * 11000
 * 00100
 * 00011
 *
 * Output: 3
