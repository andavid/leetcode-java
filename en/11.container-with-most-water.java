 * Testcase Example:  '[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]'
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a
 * point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two
 * endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together
 * with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most
 * water.
 *
 * Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In
 * this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is
 * 49.

 * Example:
 *
 *
 * Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 * Output: 49
